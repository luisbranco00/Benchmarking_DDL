# Project Overview
This project benchmarks distributed deep learning frameworks in healthcare applications, focusing on TensorFlow (TF) 2.12 and PyTorch (Torch) 2.1. It utilizes ResNet50 and Inception V3 architectures with BreastMnist and PathMnist datasets, and employs a Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN) with the Brats dataset. The project also explores the parameter server approach in TensorFlow and compares it with the multi-mirrored worker strategy in TF and the Distributed Data Parallel method in Torch.
